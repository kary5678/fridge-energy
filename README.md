# Refrigeration and Energy Usage

This repository consists of materials used in my final project for a class on effective data visualization. The project explores the energy usage of refrigerators based on their features, in an effort to understand what fridges are energy efficient.

## Final Deliverable

The final product submitted is an [Adobe Spark site](https://express.adobe.com/page/iReIdngvT2Lye/) compiling all the visuals made in R to tell the story.
